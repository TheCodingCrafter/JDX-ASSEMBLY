=====Instructions====
* = not done or work in progress
? = maybe coming soon, maybe not

=====Data-Based Instructions=====
mov  ------ moves a value into a register (mov <REGISTER> <VALUE>) value can be the contents of the temporary
            register if you specify it as [\*\] or the second as [\**\]
ldt  ------ loads a register's value into the temporary register (ldt <REGISTER>)
ldt2  ------ loads a register's value into the second temporary register (ldt2 <REGISTER>)
rd   ------ converts a register to a integer (rd <REGISTER>)
xrd  ------ converts a register to a float (xrd <REGISTER>)
str  ------ converts a register to a string (str <REGISTER>)

=====Arithmetic Instructions=====
add  ------ adds a value to a register, value can be the contents of the temporary
            register if you specify it as [\*\] or the second as [\**\] (add <REGISTER> <VALUE>)
sub  ------ subtracts a value from a register, value can be the contents of the temporary
            register if you specify it as [\*\] or the second as [\**\] (sub <REGISTER> <VALUE>)
mul  ------ multiplies a register by a value, value can be the contents of the temporary
            register if you specify it as [\*\] or the second as [\**\] (mul <REGISTER> <VALUE>)
div  ------ divides a register by a value, value can be the contents of the temporary
            register if you specify it as [\*\] or the second as [\**\] (div <REGISTER> <VALUE>)

===== Misc Instructions=====
jmp  ------ jumps to a specified line in the code by setting the program counter variable (jmp <LINE>)
jnz  ------ jumps to a specified line in the code if specified register is not zero (jnz <REGISTER> <LINE>)
invk ------ invokes an command (invk <COMMAND>)
require --- imports an external library (require <LIBRARY_NAME>)
inpt ------ gets user input (inpt <PROMPT>)
fnc  ------ calls a function loaded from a library (fnc <FUNCTION_NAME>)
end  ------ what do you think it does, ends the program

=====Flags=====
#debug ---- enables debug information (#debug)
#admin *

=====Registers=====
A-Z ------ normal data registers
al  ------ register used for printing
pc  ------ read-only register containing the value of the program counter
fc  ------ read-only register containing the return value of the last executed fuction


=====Commands=====
AL_PRT prints the value of register "al"
