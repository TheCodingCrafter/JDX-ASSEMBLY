The Official Repository for JDX-Assembly.


# DOCS
Primitive documentation can be found in "Architecture.txt".
Better more detailed docs coming soon.

JDX-Assembly is in open-beta, meaning it is buggy, it will run the test.jdx file by default, you may edit the file to change this and ONLY this.
Submit bug reports if you find one, but check if there already is one.
